#Gestures in General

Each codebase in our applications should be readable inside out. Each code block, application file or snippet would look as if
it came from a novel, a book or a text file. Has an introduction, a plot and an ending. No codebase should look as if it was
created out of scrap or from a draft.

The simplier the code the better. Always remember, if you copy-pasted the code, it means its already wrong. Never re-use a codeblock.
