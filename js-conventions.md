### JS

In most cases, it's safest to follow the code style of the project codebase.

Note that we are writing in ES6. We loosely follow the [Airbnb's ES6 style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6) (and this one for [ES5](https://github.com/airbnb); if you don't know about ES5/ES6, just use this one) with a few notable exceptions.

In summary,

- Use semicolons;
- Commas last,
- 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Prefer `'` over `"`
- 80 character line length
- "Attractive"
- Do not use the optional parameters of setTimeout and setInterval
