### JS

In most cases, it's safest to follow the code style of the project codebase you're working on.

Note that we are writing in ES6. We loosely follow the [Airbnb's ES6 style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/) (and this one for [ES5](https://github.com/airbnb)) with a few notable exceptions.

In summary,

- Use semicolons;
- Commas last,
- 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Prefer `'` over `"`
- 80 character line length
- "Attractive"
- Do not use the optional parameters of `setTimeout` and `setInterval`

### ReactJS
- Refer to [John Cobb's Best Practices](https://web-design-weekly.com/2015/01/29/opinionated-guide-react-js-best-practices-conventions/)

### Redux
- Always use constants for your action types.
- Refer to [Flux Standard Actions](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action)
